# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting the **Requirement Analysis Project**, which focuses on establishing a solid foundation for software development by identifying, analyzing, and organizing system requirements.

Through this project, we simulate a real-world booking management system scenario to apply industry-standard techniques for capturing both functional and non-functional requirements, creating use case diagrams, and setting clear acceptance criteria.

The objective is to produce clear, structured, and professional documentation that aligns with the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and supports successful system implementation.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system.

It serves as the foundation upon which the entire project is built, ensuring that developers, designers, testers, and clients are all aligned on what the software should do. This phase bridges the gap between vague business needs and clear, actionable technical requirements.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:

- **Clarity of Scope:** Clearly defines what needs to be built and what is out of scope.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Helps ensure all parties have a shared understanding of the system's goals and features.
- **Prevents Rework:** Early identification of needs reduces the chances of costly changes during later phases.
- **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a reference point for system architecture, coding, and testing.
- **Improves Quality:** Well-defined requirements lead to better system design, fewer bugs, and higher user satisfaction.

Without a thorough requirement analysis, projects are likely to face delays, increased costs, and misaligned expectations, ultimately compromising software quality and user satisfaction.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in determining the success of a software project. It acts as the foundation upon which all other phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are built. Below are three key reasons why it is critically important:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
By thoroughly analyzing and documenting requirements, all stakeholders—developers, clients, designers, and testers—share a common understanding of the project goals. This clarity minimizes misunderstandings and reduces the risk of scope creep or unapproved feature additions.

### 2. Saves Time and Cost
Identifying requirements early helps in catching inconsistencies, missing functionalities, and incorrect assumptions before development begins. This significantly reduces the need for rework, thus saving both time and money throughout the project lifecycle.

### 3. Improves Quality and User Satisfaction
Well-analyzed and documented requirements lead to systems that meet real user needs. When expectations are accurately translated into features, the end product is more likely to satisfy user expectations and business goals, resulting in higher quality software.

In short, Requirement Analysis ensures that the right product is built in the right way, with minimal waste and maximum alignment with business objectives.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities to ensure that the system's requirements are accurately captured, understood, and documented. Below are the five key activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**
    - Involves collecting high-level needs and expectations from stakeholders such as clients, users, and business analysts.
    - Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions, and reviewing existing documentation.

- **Requirement Elicitation**
    - Focuses on extracting detailed information and clarifying ambiguous or conflicting requirements.
    - This step often involves engaging deeply with stakeholders to uncover hidden needs or constraints.

- **Requirement Documentation**
    - All gathered and elicited requirements are documented in a clear, organized, and standardized format.
    - Common documentation includes Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, and use cases.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
    - Analyzes the collected requirements to ensure feasibility, consistency, and completeness.
    - Uses tools and techniques such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship models to visually represent the system.

- **Requirement Validation**
    - Ensures that the documented requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.
    - Typically involves stakeholder reviews, walkthroughs, and formal inspections.

These activities collectively ensure that the software system is designed with a solid understanding of what needs to be built and why.

## Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are broadly categorized into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential for building a complete, effective, and reliable system.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system should do. These are the core features and functionalities that the software must provide to meet user and business needs.

**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe the behaviors, services, and functions the system must perform under specific conditions.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users can create, view, update, or cancel bookings.
- The system must allow admins to manage room availability and booking slots.
- The system should send email confirmations upon successful booking.
- Users must be able to search for available rooms by date, time, or type.
- The system should allow user registration and login with role-based access.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify how the system performs its functions. These are quality attributes that influence user experience and system performance.

**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements define constraints and standards such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system should be able to handle 1000+ concurrent users without performance degradation.
- Page load time should not exceed 2 seconds under normal load.
- The application must comply with GDPR for data privacy.
- The system should be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).
- All user data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

Understanding the distinction between these two types helps ensure that both user expectations and technical standards are met.
