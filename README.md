# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting the **Requirement Analysis Project**, which focuses on establishing a solid foundation for software development by identifying, analyzing, and organizing system requirements.

Through this project, we simulate a real-world booking management system scenario to apply industry-standard techniques for capturing both functional and non-functional requirements, creating use case diagrams, and setting clear acceptance criteria.

The objective is to produce clear, structured, and professional documentation that aligns with the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and supports successful system implementation.
