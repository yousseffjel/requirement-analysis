# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting the **Requirement Analysis Project**, which focuses on establishing a solid foundation for software development by identifying, analyzing, and organizing system requirements.

Through this project, we simulate a real-world booking management system scenario to apply industry-standard techniques for capturing both functional and non-functional requirements, creating use case diagrams, and setting clear acceptance criteria.

The objective is to produce clear, structured, and professional documentation that aligns with the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and supports successful system implementation.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system.

It serves as the foundation upon which the entire project is built, ensuring that developers, designers, testers, and clients are all aligned on what the software should do. This phase bridges the gap between vague business needs and clear, actionable technical requirements.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:

- **Clarity of Scope:** Clearly defines what needs to be built and what is out of scope.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Helps ensure all parties have a shared understanding of the system's goals and features.
- **Prevents Rework:** Early identification of needs reduces the chances of costly changes during later phases.
- **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a reference point for system architecture, coding, and testing.
- **Improves Quality:** Well-defined requirements lead to better system design, fewer bugs, and higher user satisfaction.

Without a thorough requirement analysis, projects are likely to face delays, increased costs, and misaligned expectations, ultimately compromising software quality and user satisfaction.
